FGNmeaKit
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fguchelaar/FGNmeaKit.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fguchelaar/FGNmeaKit)

Library for parsing NMEA sentences... More info later, when there is actually something to show.

I currently do not have a crystal clear design in mind, so this library will probably evolve organically to suit my
needs and hopefully will result in a library suitable for wider use.

## Todo's
* Add logging, [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack) looks like a good option.
